Quick collection of "brute force" tools that I have found
to be very simple yet effective. Yes I know its not state 
of the art thingies...but it saved me a lot of time.
So I share it. All coded in PERL. Modify as you wish. Redistribute
as you wish without giving me credit. Go bananas...:)

Getting usernames
=================

fingers
-------
Does a whole lot of "fingers" on a host with commonly used usernames.
Real easy. Effectively used to extract usernames when a host has the
finger daemon running.

Usage: perl fingers.pl <target>

expn
----
Same as above - use it when the host's SMTP server allows you to do
a EXPN. 

Usage: perl expn.pl <target>

Getting host names
==================

dnsbrute
--------
So you can't do a DNS zone transfer. Eish. This script will try to resolve
commonly known DNS names - e.g ns1.target.com.

Usage: perl dnsbrute.pl <target_domain> <list_to_test>

I distribute it with some common names (common) and some Greek god names
(greek), seeing that everyone use it.

Have fun,
Roelof.
